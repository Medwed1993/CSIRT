# CRITS manual

CRITs is an open source malware and threat repository that leverages other open source software to create a unified tool for analysts and security experts engaged in threat defense. It has been in development since 2010 with one goal in mind: give the security community a flexible and open platform for analyzing and collaborating on threat data. In making CRITs free and open source, we can provide organizations around the world with the capability to quickly adapt to an ever-changing threat landscape. CRITs can be installed locally for a private isolated instance or shared among other trusted organizations as a collaborative defense mechanism.
